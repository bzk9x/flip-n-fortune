# Flip n Fortune

Flip n Fortune is a simple yet addictive coin-flipping game where you test your luck against the odds. Starting with $100, players flip a coin with asymmetric outcomes:

- Heads: Win 90% of your current balance
- Tails: Lose 50% of your current balance

The game offers single flips or quick multi-flip options (3x or 10x) for those feeling extra lucky. Your goal is to build the highest balance possible before inevitably going bust when your funds drop below $1.

The game features a visually appealing interface with animated coin flips and tracks your stats over time, including your all-time high score, total number of flips, and games played. All progress is automatically saved to your device, allowing you to continue your fortune-building journey across multiple sessions.

Perfect for quick gaming sessions and challenging friends to beat your high score, Flip n Fortune demonstrates how even simple probability games can create compelling risk/reward dynamics.
